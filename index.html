Hello and Welcome to the Falafel Atlas
This is my diary of all the Falafel Restaurants I visit. Many of them are in Berlin,
but every now and then I get to eat Falafel elsewhere in the world. In the domain of Falafel, my main expertise lies in critiquing Falafel
sandwiches and wraps, but I also enjoy eating falafel plates. Of course, other dishes that are often available at Falafel Places
are also very dear to me, but I don't want this to turn into a food blog. If there is a Falafel place you think I should visit,
please send me an email to <a href="mailto:friedrich.wicke@protonmail.com">friedrich.wicke@protonmail.com</a>.
